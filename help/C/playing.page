	<title>Playing a Game</title>

	<p>To start a new game, press the menu button in the top-right corner of the window, and select <gui style="menuitem">New Game</gui>.
		If you are already playing a
		game, <app>Tilepaint</app> will ask if you want to stop the current game.</p>
	<p>To paint a cell, click on it; to unpaint it again, click on it again. While you paint cells individually, remember that every cell in a region must be in the same state (either all painted or all unpainted) to complete the puzzle correctly.</p>
	<p>You can also play <app>Tilepaint</app> using your keyboard. To move the cell cursor, use the
		<key>Arrow</key> keys, <key>WASD</key>, or <key>HJKL</key> (Vim-style). Once the cursor is
		over a cell, press <key>Space</key> or <key>Enter</key> to paint it.</p>
	<p>
		<app>Tilepaint</app> also allows you to tag cells for your own reference when solving a board. Using a mouse, this can be achieved by holding
		<key>Ctrl</key> or <key>Shift</key> and clicking on a cell. Using a keyboard, hold <key>Ctrl</key> or <key>Shift</key> and press <key>Space</key> or <key>Enter</key>.
		They both tag cells differently, and cells can be tagged in
		both manners at the same time. Tagged cells can be un-tagged by clicking or pressing the play key on them again while holding either <key>Ctrl</key>
		or <key>Shift</key> again.</p>
	<p>To undo or redo a move, press <gui style="button">
		<media its:translate="no" type="image" src="figures/edit-undo-symbolic.svg">
			<span its:translate="yes">Undo</span>
		</media>
	</gui> or
	<gui style="button">
		<media its:translate="no" type="image" src="figures/edit-redo-symbolic.svg">
			<span its:translate="yes">Redo</span>
		</media>
	</gui>
		in the header bar. You may undo or redo as many moves as you like without
		restriction.</p>
<p>To get a hint on which cells to paint out, press <gui style="button">
	<media its:translate="no" type="image" src="figures/dialog-question-symbolic.svg">
		<span its:translate="yes">Hint</span>
	</media>
</gui> in the header bar. A cell
		will be hinted with a flashing red outline. This shows that the current status of the cell (painted or unpainted) is incorrect,
		and should be changed for the game to be won.</p>
