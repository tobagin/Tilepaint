	<title>Tilepaint the Game</title>

	<p>Tilepaint (also known as Crazy Pavement) is a logic puzzle where the goal is to paint cells in a grid divided into regions (tiles). The following rules apply:</p>
	<list>
		<item>
			<p>Each region (tile) must be either entirely painted or entirely unpainted.</p>
		</item>
		<item>
			<p>The numbers at the top and left of the grid indicate how many cells in each column and row, respectively, must be painted.</p>
		</item>
	</list>
	<p>A puzzle is solved when all regions are correctly set to either painted or unpainted, and all row and column totals match the clues.</p>
